# Deep Thoughts

This is a backend for a theoretical social media site called Deep Thoughts, wherein one can upload thoughts, reply to them with reactions, and mark other users as friends. This backend is bare-bones, but includes routes to add, view, update, and remove users, thoughts, and reactions, and to add and remove friends from a user's friends list.

Deep Thoughts is built with Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

# How to Use

This app does not have a front-end, though the backend can be run locally and interacted with via software like Insomnia or Postman. To demo Deep Thoughts, first make sure you have both MongoDB and Node.js installed. If you don't have Mongo, check out these installation instructions: https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb.

Once you have that software installed, you can either download the code to your computer or clone the respository. Then, navigate to the root directory, run `npm i` to install its dependencies, and then `npm start` to start the server.
