# Deep Thoughts

This is a backend for a theoretical social media site called Deep Thoughts, wherein one can upload thoughts, reply to them with reactions, and mark other users as friends. This backend is bare-bones, but includes routes to add, view, update, and remove users, thoughts, and reactions, and to add and remove friends from a user's friends list.

# How to Use

This app does not have a front-end. To use, download or clone the code to your computer. Using your terminal of choice, navigate to the root directory and run `npm i`, then `npm start`.
